'''

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1

Output: [1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,2], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

# Syntax Notes:

'''
- can extract tuples from hashmaps, just iterate using h.items()

- use sorted on tuples 

- .sort is meant for the list class and is nlgn time, thats why sorted is for most other data structures 

- sorted returns a completely new object, .sort modifies the object that it was called with and doesnt return anything

- can access tuples in a list using 2d array notation, eg, first element of the first tuple in a list can be accessed using my_tuple_list[0][0]
